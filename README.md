# CarNotesApp

CarNotesApp is a simple web application designed to track maintenance notes for multiple vehicles. This app was created to solve a specific problem where the SmartCar API no longer allowed free access to manage multiple vehicles, limiting its usefulness for tracking all vehicle data. 

This app provides a straightforward and free solution to maintain a central place for all car maintenance records.

## Why It Was Created
Originally, I used the SmartCar API to track vehicle data, but the free plan allowed access to only one vehicle. Since I wanted a free tool that could handle multiple vehicles, I decided to create this simple application to meet my needs without ongoing costs.
